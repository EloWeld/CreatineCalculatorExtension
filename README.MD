# Chrome Extension: Creatinine Calculator

This Chrome extension provides a convenient calculator for estimating creatinine clearance using three different equations: Cockcroft-Gault Equation, MDRD GFR Equation, and 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine-Cystatin C equation. 

## Features
- **Cockcroft-Gault Equation**: Estimates creatinine clearance based on serum creatinine, age, weight, and gender.
- **MDRD GFR Equation**: Estimates glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine, age, race, and gender.
- **2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine-Cystatin C**: Calculates GFR using both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels.

## How to Use
1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Click on the extension icon in the browser toolbar.
3. Enter the required parameters for the desired equation.
4. The extension will calculate and display the estimated creatinine clearance or GFR.
